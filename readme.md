##  Overview

The project named AppGuard serves as a robust system stability manager, identifying and terminating potentially unsafe processes according to predefined system standards. Leveraging runtime commands and process analysis, AppGuard ensures the smooth operation of critical system functions. The project streamlines Guava library version management through centralized dependency configuration, enhancing maintainability and consistency within the codebase.
